			A more powerful replacement for the default ngClick designed to be used on touchscreen devices. 
			Most mobile browsers wait about 300ms after a tap-and-release before sending the click event. 
			This version handles them immediately, and then prevents the following click event from propagating.

			Specify custom behavior when an element is swiped to the left on a touchscreen device. 
			A leftward swipe is a quick, right-to-left slide of the finger. 
			Though ngSwipeLeft is designed for touch-based devices, it will work with a mouse click and drag too.
